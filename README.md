# php-ip-logger
nothing too special just a php ip logger with og support

# What quick info
    1. It has OG(open graph) support which means u can be creative with the link embed
    2. you can easily phish the link in discord you can see in #what it looks like
    3. can detect vpns [very buggy with phones] due to ipv6
    4. you can easily add cookie logging if you're creative
    5. Has auto redirect you can change it to discord.com but i have it as skadaddle.cc check it at the end of the code
    it just makes the link less sus. somewhat??
